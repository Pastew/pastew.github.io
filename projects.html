                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p>Let's get back to the roots. Remember playing Pegasus/SNES in front of your TV? Remember that one tough boss level, even your older brother couldn't beat? Well, in our game you can BE the boss, and finally take revenge.</p>
                        <p>"Boss Level" is a game for two to five players, where up to four players play a platformer in 2D and additional one is playing the "boss" on a VR headset - seeing the players below and trying to kill them by throwing hammers at them. Players, on the other hand, have to collect bananas to defeat the boss.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Tech info</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One player plays on any SteamVR supporting VR headset - he is a cloud that throws hammers on monkeys.</li>
                            <li>Up to 4 players play with any standard game controller, like Xbox gamepad. They are monkeys in 2D world trying to avoid hammers and try to gather enough bananas to win.</li>
                            <li>Unity used for game.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This project was done by four people in 48 hours. We got an audience award for this game. I was working mostly on VR part of this game.</p>

                        <p>Game about having minimum wage job tightening screws under rather unpleasant leadership. You have to tighten the screws.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Too much force will break it.</li>
                            <li>Too little will make your boss angry.</li>
                            <li>Too many mistakes will make you get fired!</li>
                            <li>You get 5 groszy for every screw you tighten correctly.</li>
                            <li>Timer speeds up, you have to hurry up!</li>

                        <h3>Tech info</h3>
                        <p>The game uses 2 custom controllers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1st controller = Arduino + Potentiometer + 3D printed case + 3D printed spanner designed and printed during the jam.</li>
                            <li>2nd Controller is a computer's microphone. You have to shout loudly to get next bolt.</li>
                            <li>Blender used for 3D modeling.</li>
                            <li>Unity used for game.</li>

                        <p>This project was done by two people in 48 hours. We got a first place prize for this game and we are super happy about it, especially there were about 150 other people, (~40 teams) there.</p>

                        <p>This was my Master's thesis project - an intermediary platform connecting game developers with advertisers for in-game ad placements.</p>
                        <p>I designed and implemented the entire system from scratch, including the microservices architecture, business model, and both client and server applications. The project was a valuable learning experience as I wanted to explore Spring Boot and microservices architecture.</p>

                        <p>A unique arcade/puzzle game where you take on the role of an ad blocker. Incoming data packets must be correctly classified - allowing legitimate content (cat pictures and memes) while blocking ads. Your speed, observation skills, and multitasking abilities will be put to the test!</p>
                        <p>Built during a 48-hour game jam with a teammate. I handled coding while my teammate created design and assets.</p>

                        <p>You're working as a radio broadcasting station operator in soviet-occupied Poland. You have lots of power and great responsibility. Will you be smart and brave enough to get rid of this fatal establishment and finally set the country free? Emit proper radio programs to influence people in polish cities, react properly for various fascinating historical (and fictional) events and splendidly avoid government agents, so you don't end up as a public enemy. Become the master of propaganda. Let the waves of freedom flow!</p>
                        
                        <p>This project was done by three people in 48 hours. I was fully responsible for coding while my friends handled the design, gameplay balancing and assets.</p>

                        <p>I created this car during my engineering studies when I attended additional classes at the SKIP scientific club. I learned electronics, 3D modeling, and web technologies. The rotating turret was designed in SketchUp and 3D printed. Later it became the subject of my engineering work.</p>
